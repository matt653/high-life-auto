Motor sounds good and it shifts the way it's supposed to.     *4x4 works. Brakes and suspension are solid.     *    Passenger side window likely needs a regulator.     *    Recent Major Maintenance & Repairs:     Brand new Nissan OEM fuel pump installed.    New Nissan OEM crank and cam sensors. Still seems to have a longer crank than normal (I think).     Brand new battery (installed November/December last year).","Tilt Wheel; Immobilizer; Keyless Entry; Dual Front Airbags; Side Airbags; Head Airbags; Rear Head Airbags; Active Seatbelts; Crew Cab; Regular Bed; All Wheel ABS","https://cdn.frazerphotos.com/22489/22489_000003979_thg9ggy.jpg,https://cdn.frazerphotos.com/22489/22489_000003979_kkg47xd.jpg,https://cdn.frazerphotos.com/22489/22489_000003979_5ohoxgg.jpg,https://cdn.frazerphotos.com/22489/22489_000003979_lsdryk3.jpg,https://cdn.frazerphotos.com/22489/22489_000003979_vryhbs6.jpg,https://cdn.frazerphotos.com/22489/22489_000003979_17nnpuw.jpg,https://cdn.frazerphotos.com/22489/22489_000003979_wup3dxj.jpg,https://cdn.frazerphotos.com/22489/22489_000003979_h36pid7.jpg,https://cdn.frazerphotos.com/22489/22489_000003979_l26acww.jpg,https://cdn.frazerphotos.com/22489/22489_000003979_yek2dyl.jpg,https://cdn.frazerphotos.com/22489/22489_000003979_lk5y3cg.jpg,https://cdn.frazerphotos.com/22489/22489_3979_3948.jpg,https://cdn.frazerphotos.com/22489/22489_3979_3947.jpg"

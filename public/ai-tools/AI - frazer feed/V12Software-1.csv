These batteries were only designed to last 10 years/100k miles. As you can see from the battery health meter in this picture it appears that the battery has recently been changed. Brand new, these cars were rated for 85 miles. The highest I've seen on a full charge is 72 so far which is really really really good! This car runs and drives just like it should. Wipers, radio, windows, turn signals, etc all work. Even has cold ac if you don't mind losing 7 miles of range (on a full charge) while you drive. Cruise and all the power options work as they should! And we just put new tires on it!<br><br>Take a Look at:","04/04/2023","Hatchback","       ","4","Used"

They are one of the safest on the road and they are all AWD vehicles. On top of the AWD, this car will get great MPG. This one is a pretty good looking vehicle. The radio, heat, heated seats, windows, sunroof, turn signals, wipers, cruise, horn and wiper fluid all work the way they should. It drives very well and accelerates well. I don't hear any suspension noise on the highway and the brakes are solid. We replaced the control arm, ball joint, steering knuckle, outer tie rod, and sway bar end link on the driver's side and the ball joint on the passenger side. It's going in for an alignment on Tuesday 3/19<br><br>Take a Look at: The tires are about 25% all the way around. The switch for the rear passenger side window on the driver's door does not work.","02/20/2024","SUV","       ","4","Used"

It has the black leather, double sunroof, backup camera, navigation, automatic rear hatch, front and rear heated seats and it's AWD. The windows, sunroof, radio, heat, ac, turn signals, wipers, wiper fluid, horn and cruise all work the way they should. The tire pressure light WAS on, but I just had a low tire, so all the sensors work as they should! It drives smooth and it has good power. I don't hear any suspension noise and the brakes are solid.<br><br>Take a Look at: The tires are about 30% all the way around (except the rear passenger must be a spare becuase it has about 75%). There is a check engine light (P0455 Evaporative Emission System Leak Detected-Large Leak, P0171 System Too Lean Bank 1, P0174 System Too Lean Bank 2). The wipers and driver's side turn signal need replaced, but I am ordering those today.","10/18/2023","SUV","       ","4","Used"
